## Captions from [A Softer World comic](http://www.asofterworld.com/archive.php)

+ I have found a way to watch video in your head. High definition, with instant replay. It is called having regrets.

+ Maybe next year is the year, maybe last year.

+ We need more good crazy. It'd be nice to watch the news, and think, 'that's fucking insane', but feel a little jealous instead of just alone.

+ Every statue in town came to life, but they'd been watching long enough to know better than to ever move.

+ I don't know if your wings are real, but I've never seen you without them, and I follow you everywhere.

+ I had all kinds of plans in case of a zombie attack. I just figured I'd be on the other side.

+ If at first you don't succeed...run.

+ Tell me your heart doesn't race for a hurricane or a burning building.

+ Remember when your potential was a promise instead of a regret?

+ Before we teach computers to love maybe we should teach them about personal boundaries

+ Our bodies are ours to break, ours to throw into rivers, ours to light on fire, ours to launch into the depths of space

+ Being in love is totally punk rock.

+ What kind of person talks trash during a chess game?

+ I'm married to the sea/ but don't tell her I called her that

+ I have super powers and a costume/ every night I panic just outside my door/ but every night I try again

+ I sing anyway.

+ I wonder, sometimes, what people see when they look at me. I am supposed to be disguised as a fern.

+ CAN'T STOP/ WON'T STOP/ NOT SURE HOW TO STOP

+ I think I've got fireflies where my caution should be.

+ Some days are magic, and I can do anything. The other days, I just have to wait/ and hope it comes back.

+ I have a two part question. 1. What would you do if you were going to die? 2. How did you ever convince yourself you weren't?

+ I wish I could build a tree house up high enough to finger clouds.

+ This is the way the world ends/ not with a bang but/ only because explosions don't make sound in space.

+ You are never so low that you deserve to be lower.

+ You'll never see the end of your own story, so maybe you should throw in some more sub-plots?

+ It's time to make yourself proud and everyone else a little nervous.

+ Dancing like a crazy person alone in you room. That's why.

+ I love the way your face lights up when someone says "It might be dangerous."

+ Ten years of astronaut training/ so I can install signage?/ "You just proved moon advertising works."

+ Give me liberty./ I do not feel like you should have a second option here.

+ I made a bunch of stickers/ to put on rooftops, and in secret tunnels./ "If you're reading this, then you are awesome."

+ The world is ending, and people are taking pictures/ that won't last.

+ She doesn't take any shit from vegetables, for instance.

+ I'm afraid to go on this mission, afraid of sabotage, of system failure/ but when I tried to tell my mother/ she smiled so wide and said "my son the astronaut"
