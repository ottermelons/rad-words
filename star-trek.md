# Star Trek!

    Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life-forms and new civilizations; to boldly go where no one has gone before.

### From The Original Series:

* After a time you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing as wanting. It is not logical, but is often true. -Spock, in "This Side of paradise"

* They like you very much, but they are not the hell "your" whales. -Spock, in _The Voyage Home_

* Everybody remember where we parked. -Kirk, in _The Voyage Home_


### From the Rebooted Alternate Original Series:

* Space is disease and danger wrapped in darkness and silence. -Bones, in _Star Trek_

* Yeah, well, I got nowhere else to go. The ex-wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce. All I got left is my bones. -Bones, in _Star Trek_

* The only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration. 
[In a tone reserved for telling someone to 'Go to Hell'] Live long and prosper. -Spock, in _Star Trek_

* I intend to assist in the effort to reestablish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale is better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I will gladly defer to your medical expertise. Excuse me. -Spock, in _Star Trek_

* Maybe I love it. -Jim Kirk, in _Star Trek_

* I dare you to do better. -Captain Christopher Pike, in _Star Trek_

* What is necessary is never unwise. -Sarek, in _Star Trek_

* Maximum warp. Punch it. -Captain Christopher Pike, in _Star Trek_

* The notion of transwarp beaming is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse. -Scotty, in _Star Trek_

* Four years? I'll do it in three. -Jim Kirk, in _Star Trek_

* I don't believe in no-win scenarios. -Jim Kirk, in _Star Trek_

* The purpose is to experience fear, fear in the face of certain death, to accept that fear, and maintain control of oneself and one's crew. This is the quality expected in every Starfleet captain. -Spock, in _Star Trek_

* Stardate: 2258.42... or, uh, 4... Whatever.  -Jim Kirk, in _Star Trek_

* Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking and targeting our ship. I don't suppose this is a problem either. -Bones, in _Star Trek_

* Well, should we - I dunno - _fire back?_ ... Oh, of _course_ not! -Bones, in _Star Trek_

* Spock, you are fully capable of deciding your own destiny. The question you face is: which path will you choose? This is something only you can decide. -Sarek, in _Star Trek_
